C++ program for implementing the RSA cryptosystem using various efficient algorithms like
  i)    Euclid GCD and Extended Euclid GCD
  ii)   Miller-Rabin probablistic algorithm for primality test
  iii)  Naive Power
  
Also in this program instead of using ASCII table for assignment, I have used a custom assignment in which
    blank character is assigned the value 0
    a, …, z are assigned the values 1, …, 26, respectively
So the encoded message will be availabe with base 27
